    1. Our Plant in space. - solar system & planets Can you arrange the planets in the correct order? Click and drag each planet
    to their correct place in the solar system. This sentence might help you remember the order of the planets: "My Very
    Easy Method Just Speeds Up Naming". Each letter in the sentence is the first letter of each planet. - earth 2. Planet
    earth - why earth is important to study. - the cross-section of earth. - earth Our planet is made up of many different
    layers. The layer we live on is called the crust. This thin layer is made up of many different plates that move along
    the crust. Below the crust is the mantle. This layer is made up of rocks. The centre of the Earth is the core. The core
    is made up of two layers, the outer and inner core. The outer core is a liquid layer, while the inner core is a boiling
    hot solid layer. - continents A continent is a large body of land that covers part of the Earth’s surface. The Earth
    is made up of seven continents. They are Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia , Europe, North America and South America.
    Click on each of the continents to find out more information. - hemisphere: The Earth is made up of two hemispheres,
    the Northern and Southern hemispheres. The Equator is an imaginary line that divides the planet in two. - water Over
    two thirds of our planet is covered in water. It is because of this that our planet is often called the ‘The Blue Planet’.
    The water on our planet is the same water that was drank by dinosaurs millions of years ago! With so much water on our
    planet, oceans are an important part of it. - Oceans of the World There are five oceans on the Earth. These are the Pacific,
    Atlantic, Indian, Arctic and Antarctic Ocean . These oceans all flow into each other. Click on each ocean to find out
    more. - Water conservation Even though so much of our planet is covered in water, we can only use 1% of this water. Most
    of the water is salty and undrinkable. Water is very precious and we need to conserve it. Water is an essential part
    of life. Yet, millions of people around the world face water shortages daily. A person could survive without food for
    a month, but would only last a few days without water. It is important we don’t waste water and damage the environment.
    Here are some ways you can play your part in conserving water. -rain forests of the world The rainforests of the world
    are found north and south of the Equator. Only 6% of the Earth is covered in rainforests, yet over half the world’s species
    of animals and plants are found in this beautiful habitat. Rainforests are a hot, humid and wet place. This precious
    environment is in danger. The destruction of the rainforest is called deforestation. Rainforest trees are cut down for
    wood or to clear land for farming. Uses of the Rainforest The rainforest is home to many different people with their
    own unique customs and traditions. The rainforest is home to so many unique animals and plants. The plants in the rainforest
    produce much of the Earth’s oxygen that we need to survive. Over one quarter of the world’s medicine needed to help fight
    diseases and illnesses come from the plants found in the rainforest. -Antarctica Antarctica is found at the southern
    most tip of the Earth. It is the coldest and windiest place on the Earth. Antarctica is the fifth largest continent in
    the world, larger than Europe and Australia . It is 14 million square kilometres. Antarctica has no permanent human population.
    This frozen land is home to many animals from penguins to seals. These animals adapt to their cold environment. Antarctica
    is a unique and spectacular place of great beauty. Yet, this special habitat is in danger. Many of the rare animals of
    Antarctica were hunted almost to extinction in the past. There are increasing numbers of tourists visiting Antarctica.
    This can lead to pollution of this unique land. Antarctica is rich in natural resources. It is feared that mining may
    begin in the future in Antarctica as the other natural resources on our planet are running out. It is important that
    Antarctica is protected for future generations. -Exploring Europe Ireland is a part of Europe, the second smallest continent
    in the world. Europe is surrounded by the icy Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Mediterranean
    Sea to the south. Ireland is one of the few island countries in Europe. Mainland Europe is made up of many of the countries
    from France to Italy. Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark are known as Scandinavia. Spain and Portugal are called the
    Iberian Peninsula. Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg are known as the Benelux countries. The Vatican is the smallest
    country in Europe. It is located in the city of Rome in Italy and has a population of less than one thousand. The Vatican
    is home to the pope. The highest mountain in Europe is Mount Elbrus in the Caucasus Mountains at 5,642 metres. It also
    forms a border between Europe and Asia. The Volga is the longest river in Europe. It is 3,865 km long. It flows through
    Russia. During the winter, most of the river is frozen. The European Union was first set up in 1957 to allow the countries
    of Europe to work together. Ireland joined in 1973. - passport - local town - -
